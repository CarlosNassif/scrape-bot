# Scrape Bot

## About the web scrape

This web scrape was built following the course [Modern Web Scraping in Python](https://www.udemy.com/course/modern-web-scraping-in-python/). With it, I was able to scrape a test page [Books to Scrape](https://books.toscrape.com/) and learn more about Spiders and Web Scraping.

During the course I learned more about web scrape technologies, such as [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/), [Scrapy](https://scrapy.org/), [BeautifulSoup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/), [Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/) and a tip of [Puppeteer](https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer#readme).
