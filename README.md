# Scrape Bot

## About the web scrape

This web scrape was built following the course [Modern Web Scraping in Python](https://www.udemy.com/course/modern-web-scraping-in-python/). With it, I was able to scrape a test page [Books to Scrape](https://books.toscrape.com/) and learn more about Spiders and Web Scraping.
